# SQLProject
For college homework, I had to do a big SQL project, which included a whole lot of different queries with all kinds of SQL alteration statements. This project was a great way to get a little bit of practice on the principles of primary, foreign, and unique key constraints.

The database had the Healthcare Theme.
